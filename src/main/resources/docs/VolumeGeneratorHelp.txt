Help Manual for the VolumeGenerator

The Volume Generator produces an xml file that contains lists of doms in a given volume about a given dom.  This
information is used by the Topological Trigger to decide if a list of hits meets the topological criteria.

Current volumeId's in reigstry 'triggerConfig/resources/jar/VolumeRegistry.xml are:
0 == hexagon, smallest size, height of 34, length of 250
1 == sphere, smallest size, radius of 136
2 == cone, smallest size, one dom up, and one in length, orientation 0
3 == cone, smallest size, orientation 1
4 == cone, smallest size, orientation 2
5 == cone, smallest size, orientation 3
6 == cone, smallest size, orientation 4
7 == cone, smallest size, orientation 5
8 == allcones, all cone orientations combined, or a hexagon with one dom on the center string
9 == allcones, with a height of 2 doms up and 2 doms down
10 == allocnes, with a height of 3 doms up and 3 doms down
11 == hexagon, with a height of 68 and length of 250

orientations == There are six orientations. 0 points along the line of strings closest to due east. Orienataions rotate
around the center dom counterclockwise.

-help  This option prints this help manual.  No other options should be used at the same time.

-info  This option generates a new dom information file named default-dom-information.xml in the current directory.  It
should only be used when the default-dom-geometry is updated, so updated volumes can also be created.  All Offsets are
recorded correctly.  The a complete and correct version of the neighbors' lists has already been stored in
triggerConfig/resources/jar/neighbors-only.xml.  When this option is run, the offsets with be updated, allowing new
volumes to be constructed accurately without having to change an xml file by hand.  The order of the list represents
orientations.  0's are place holders for non existent strings.  No other options should be used at the same time.

<volumeId>  unique Id for each volume, required for every volume.

-center  height of the volume both above and below the center dom in units of doms, default = 1

-neighbor  height of the volume both above and below the neighbors of the center dom in units of doms, default = 1

-size  number of sizes outward horizantly, default = 1

-tilt  tilts the volumes by the amount <tilt> in the direction of <orientation>, not compatible with cone, cylinder,
sphere or increment modes, default is OFF

-cone  creates a cone in the direction of <orientation>, includes the strings at position <orientation>*size + 0 through
<orientation>*size + size, not cmpatible with tilt or cylinder modes, default is OFF

-cylinder  this volume contains the three strings in the direction of orientation per size, not compatible with tilt or
cone modes, default is OFF

-increment  increases the neighbor height as a function of size, example:  if increment is on and neighbor height is 1
at size one, then the height is 2 at size 2 and 3 at size 3, etc., does not affect center height, not compatiable with
sphere or tilt modes, default is OFF

-sphere  only affects heights, height depends on size as: height = Sqrt(<radius>^2-size^2), radius must be greater than
125/17*size or height will become negative, not compatiable with tilt or increment modes, default is OFF

-attribute  adds a list of attributes to the xml file in the <volume> tag, can be used multiple times in the same
command line, example: -attribute shape hexagon -attribue length 125 prints: <volume shape="hexagon" length="125">

Currently used attributes are:
shape == name of shape;  hexagon, cone, cylinder, sphere, etc.
length == length of volume
height == height of volume
radius == radius of volume
orientation == orientation of volume
toatlsize == number of doms in this volume

-output  changes the standard output file to the new file name given, default file name is 'VolumeRegistry.xml' in the
current directory

-append  changes the stanard output to the file name given, and adds the new volume in the correct place, given file
must already be a VolumeReigsttry file, allows VolumeRegistry's with multiple volumes to be created
